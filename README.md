# Time-Coverage Integrated Plots

This repo contains R and Python code to produce **time-coverage integrated plots** for planning experiments, as shown in the following paper:

* Nitin Yadav, Sebastian SardiÃ±a: [A Declarative Approach to Compact Controllers for FOND Planning via Answer Set Programming](https://ebooks.iospress.nl/doi/10.3233/FAIA230593). ECAI 2023: 2818-2825

There is one subplot per domain. Each planner shows the coverage % in the domain, and the average time on top of scatter plot of each instance.

## CSV data table files

The script require a CSV file containing the following columns:

* `solver`: name of solver (e.g., planner).
* `domain`: name of domain (e.g., `blocksworld`).
* `status`: integer stating the result of the run, with `1` denoting _solved successfully_.
* `solved`: boolean stating if run was solved.
* `cputime`: time taken.



## 1. Seaborn-based Python plots

Notebook [coverage_plots.ipynb](coverage_plots.ipynb) plot integrated time-coverage plots using [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) Python visualization package.

An example run on [data_stats.csv](data_stats.csv) would be:

## 2. Coverage Plots in R

The same charts can be produced with Nitin's R script [r-plot/plots.R](r-plot/plots.R).

### Setup

The script requires R. In Linux:

```shell
$ sudo apt-install r-core

$ R

```

Then, install R-packages [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) packages. You can do this from command line once:

```shell
$ mkdir ~/R     # create user home for R's packages
$ export R_LIBS=$HOME/R     # install packages at user level
$ Rscript -e 'install.packages("dplyr")'
$ Rscript -e 'install.packages("ggplot2")'
```

### Generating plots

First, state the file to read from in `plot.R` line as well as other configuration parameters under the `CONSTANT` section:

```R
######################################
#### SET YOUR CONSTANTS
######################################
main_file <- "data_stats"

plot_width <- 15
plot_height <- 12
plot_dpi <- 300
```

Then, you can use [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) or simply run from command line:

```shell
$ R < plots.R --no-save
```

This should produce a PDF file and a PNG file with the plots.
